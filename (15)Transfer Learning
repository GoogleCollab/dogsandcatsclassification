use the keras layers API to pick at the layers
download the snapshot of the model from the URL which saved a copy of pretained weight
use the keras inception_v3 API for Inception model definition. Instantiate that with the desired input shape
set ‘include_top’ to false to ignore the fully-connected layer at the top
iterate through its layers and lock them (not trainable with this code)
the bottom layer is ‘mixed10’ which convoluted to 3 by 3. (examine by model.summary)
Can set the ‘last_layer’ to ‘mixed7’ which convoluted 7 by 7 (via model.get_layer('mixed7')) and take the output from it (‘last_output’) as the input InceptionV3 model

Regularization using dropouts to make your network more efficient in preventing over-specialization and overfitting. The idea behind Dropouts is that they remove a random number of neurons in your neural network.

This works very well for two reasons:

neighboring neurons often end up with similar weights, which can lead to overfitting, so dropping some out at random can remove this.
often a neuron can over-weigh the input from a neuron in the previous layer, and can over specialize as a result.
Add own DNN underneath ‘mixed7’ so that you could retrain on images using the convolutions from the other model:

from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import RMSprop

# Flatten the output layer to 1 dimension
x = layers.Flatten()(last_output)
# Add a fully connected layer with 1,024 hidden units and ReLU activation
x = layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
# Add a dropout rate of 0.2
x = layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)                  
# Add a final sigmoid layer for classification
x = layers.Dense  (1, activation='sigmoid')(x)           

model = Model( pre_trained_model.input, x) 

model.compile(optimizer = RMSprop(lr=0.0001), 
              loss = 'binary_crossentropy', 
              metrics = ['acc'])
